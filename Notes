- Use the explore query to check out the types of responses you'll get using the Foursquare API
- Look at the available venue types, see if you can correlate the number of one venue type with another
  - ie areas with tacos tend to also have art shops nearby
  
- Is it possible to track the number of check-ins or area trends over time? 
  - Would like to create a time series of check ins, correlate with #of restaurants and make a food truck map
- Can get the total number of check-ins for specific venues
- Can also get the popular hours (days and hours of the week when it's most popular)
